# Test-Driven React

This repository contains all the tests and examples from the book "Test-Driven React" - a comprehensive guide to building React applications using Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices.

## About

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code. This repository demonstrates how to apply TDD principles specifically to React applications, covering:

- Writing unit tests for React components
- Integration testing strategies
- Testing React hooks
- Mocking and stubbing techniques
- Testing user interactions
- Test-driven component design
